The Setup and Jail system allows you to configure moderation roles and create a jail system for your server.

<Note>
You need the **Administrator** permission to use these commands.
</Note>

## Setup Command

The setup command configures all moderation roles and channels:

```bash
,setup
```

This command will:
1. Create a mute role
2. Create a moderation category
3. Create a logs channel
4. Create a jail role and channel
5. Configure permissions

<Warning>
This command will create new channels and roles if they don't exist. Make sure you have enough channel and role slots available.
</Warning>

### Created Channels

- **Moderation Category**: `greed-mod`
- **Logs Channel**: `logs`
- **Jail Channel**: `jail`

<Note>
All created channels will be placed in the moderation category and will be hidden from regular users.
</Note>

### Created Roles

- **Jailed Role**: `jailed`

<Warning>
The jailed role will be configured to restrict access to all channels except the jail channel.
</Warning>

## Jail System

### Basic Usage

Jail a member:

```bash
,jail @user [reason]
```

<Note>
The member will be moved to the jail channel and restricted from accessing other channels.
</Note>

### Configuration

#### Set Jail Channel

Set the channel where jailed members will be sent:

```bash
,jail channel #channel
```

<Warning>
The channel must be accessible to the bot and the jailed role.
</Warning>

#### Set Jail Role

Set the role that will be assigned to jailed members:

```bash
,jail role @role
```

<Note>
The role should be below the bot's highest role in the hierarchy.
</Note>

### Jail Permissions

The jail system will:
1. Give jailed members access only to the jail channel
2. Remove their access from all other channels
3. Allow them to send messages only in the jail channel

<Warning>
Make sure the bot's role is above the jailed role in the role hierarchy.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Role Hierarchy**: Keep the bot's role above all moderation roles.

2. **Channel Organization**: Use the moderation category to keep all moderation-related channels together.

3. **Permission Management**: Regularly check that the jailed role's permissions are correctly set.

4. **Logging**: Use the logs channel to track moderation actions.

<Note>
The setup command is a one-time configuration. You can modify individual settings using the specific commands.
</Note>

## Common Issues

1. **Missing Permissions**: Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions to manage roles and channels.

2. **Role Hierarchy**: Check that the bot's role is above the jailed role.

3. **Channel Access**: Verify that the jail channel is accessible to the jailed role.

4. **Category Limits**: Be aware of the server's category and channel limits.

<Warning>
Always test the jail system in a safe environment before using it in your main server.
